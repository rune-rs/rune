Less then one month ago [I announced Rune on Reddit]. And the response so far
has been amazing.

In this post I'll detail the developments that have happened in the Language
since its initial announcement.

## Basic language features

Rune started out pretty bare bones, but has for the last month gotten
significantly more features that you'd expect out of a Rust-like language.

We've taught rune to understand modules and visibility, as seen with the
following test case borrowed from the [Rust reference book] (ignore the unused warnings ðŸ˜‰):

{% rune(footnote = "Modules and visibility", rune_config = '{"suppress_text_warnings": true}') %}
mod crate_helper_module {
    pub fn crate_helper() {}

    fn implementation_detail() {}
}

pub fn public_api() {}

pub mod submodule {
    use crate_helper_module;

    pub fn my_method() {
        crate_helper_module::crate_helper();
    }

    fn my_implementation() {}

    mod test {
        fn test_my_implementation() {
            super::my_implementation();
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    submodule::my_method();
}
{% end %}

## Macros

We taught Rune how to parse and execute macros. Macros are procedures which take
one token stream and transforms it to produce another. The produced token stream
is then introduced in the syntax tree of your program and included during
compilation.

This is of course, *a bit complicated*. You have to take care that macro
expansion happens in a manner that is well integrated into the rest of the
compilation. Too early, and the items produces in the macro for example can't
see imports. Too late, and it can't produce them.

Rune support for macros is currently *experimental*. Macros are restricted to
only be allowed in native modules. This makes things somewhat easier, because
native modules are written in Rust. And you get around the issue that you have
to compile the macro before you can run it.

We've learned a lot about macros from Rust. Parsing in Rune has been designed in
a way so that it can be re-used within macros, similarly to what you get through
the [`syn` crate]. We also provide our own version of the [`quote!` macro] to
produce token streams.

The following is an example macro that comes with the `std::experiments` crate.
It performs "stringy math":

```rust
use rune::ast;
use rune::macros::resolve;
use rune::{quote, Parser, Spanned, TokenStream};

/// Implementation for the `stringy_math!` macro.
pub(crate) fn stringy_math(stream: &TokenStream) -> runestick::Result<TokenStream> {
    let mut parser = Parser::from_token_stream(stream);

    let mut output = quote!(0);

    while !parser.is_eof()? {
        let op = parser.parse::<ast::Ident>()?;
        let arg = parser.parse::<ast::Expr>()?;

        output = match resolve(op)?.as_ref() {
            "add" => quote!((#output) + #arg),
            "sub" => quote!((#output) - #arg),
            "div" => quote!((#output) / #arg),
            "mul" => quote!((#output) * #arg),
            _ => {
                return Err(From::from(runestick::SpannedError::msg(
                    op.span(),
                    "unsupported operation",
                )))
            }
        }
    }

    parser.eof()?;
    Ok(output)
}
```

You can see it in action here:

{% rune(footnote = "Use of the stringy_math! macro", options = "macros=true", experimental = true) %}
use std::experiments::stringy_math;

fn main() {
    let value = stringy_math!(add 10 sub 5);
    println(`result: {value}`);
}
{% end %}

Macros are intended to be a blessed bedrock for language extension. To support
use-cases which can use a bit of custom syntax or behavior glued into a project.
The push to introduce macros has been driven by an experimental project to build
a high-level HTTP framework in Rune. One that has a similar level of ergonomics
as [Rocket]. So stay tuned for that.

## constant evaluation

Work has been started to support *constant evaluation*. Usually all code is
compiled to target the [runestick virtual machine], but constant evaluation
introduces a separate interpreted mode that the compiler can run directly.

A limited subset of the language is currently available in constant contexts,
this includes functions and `const` items. Which can do the following:

* Numerical computations.
* Simple control flow through `if`, `while`, and `loop`.
* A number of binary operators.
* String operations and templates.
* ... and a bit more

Most notably, native functions are *not* currently supported during constant
evaluation. This could in principle be introduced, but we still need to decide
which scope to limit constant evaluation to. I.e. do we want to be able to
perform database requests during constant evaluation?

Here's an example of what you can get with constant evaluation:

{% rune(footnote = "Asynchronous programming using select", manually = true) %}
const fn greeting(name) {
    `Hello {name}`
}

const GREETINGS = [
    greeting("Stranger"),
    greeting("Jane"),
    greeting("John"),
    greeting("Mio"),
];

fn main() {
    let rng = rand::Pcg64::new();
    let greetings = GREETINGS;

	println(greetings[rng.int_range(0, greetings.len())]);
}
{% end %}

As a bonus, here's the [Fibonacci example used in the playground], as a constant
function:

{% rune(footnote = "Asynchronous programming using select", manually = true) %}
const fn fib(n) {
    if n <= 1 {
        n
    } else {
        fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
    }
}

fn main() {
    fib(15)
}
{% end %}

> Note: the only difference between here and the playground is the `const`
> keyword before `fn`.

## IDE Support

Rune now has basic editor support in [rune-vscode]. A Visual Studio Code
extension that adds syntax highlighting and integration with the Rune language
server.

![Showcasing go to definitions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111092/93017349-32a28f00-f5c8-11ea-9301-5fcb586c89c8.gif)

The language server is integrated with the same compiler as Rune. Our hope is to
be able to maintain the same compiler internals for all use cases, avoiding
duplication.
