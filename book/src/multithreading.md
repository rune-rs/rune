# Multithreading

Rune is thread safe, but the [`Vm`] does not implement `Sync` so cannot directly
be shared across threads. This section details instead how you are intended to
use Rune in a multithreaded environment.

Compiling a [`Unit`] and a [`RuntimeContext`] are expensive operations compared
to the cost of calling a function. So you should try to do this as little as
possible. It is appropriate to recompile a script when the source of the script
changes. See the [Hot reloading] section for more information on this.

Once you have a `Unit` and a `RuntimeContext` they are thread safe and can be
used by multiple threads simultaneously through `Arc<Unit>` and
`Arc<RuntimeContext>`. Constructing a `Vm` with these through `Vm::new` is a
very cheap operation.

```rust
let unit: Arc<Unit> = /* todo */;
let context: Arc<RuntimeContext> = /* todo */;

std::thread::spawn(move || {
    let mut vm = Vm::new(unit, context);
    let value = vm.call(["function"], (42,))?;
    Ok(())
});
```

Using [`Vm::send_execute`] is a way to assert that a given execution is thread
safe. And allows you to use Rune in asynchronous multithreaded environments,
such as Tokio. This is achieved by ensuring that all captured arguments are
[`ConstValue`]'s, which in contrast to [`Value`]'s are guaranteed to be
thread-safe:

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/examples/tokio_spawn.rs}}
```

Finally [`Function::into_sync`] exists to coerce a function into a
[`SyncFunction`], which is a thread-safe variant of a regular [`Function`]. This
is a fallible operation since all values which are captured in the function-type
in case its a closure has to be coerced to [`ConstValue`]. If this is not the
case, the conversion will fail.
